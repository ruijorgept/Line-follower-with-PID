# Line-follower-with-PID
We designed and developed a small autonomous car that follows a black line on a white background using infrared sensors and PID control. The system also detects color markers placed along the path to trigger specific behaviors.
##  Academic Context

This project was developed as part of the curricular unit **"Projeto Integrador em Engenharia Eletrónica Industrial e Computadores 2"** during the 3rd year of the Bachelor's degree in Electronic Industrial and Computer Engineering at the **University of Minho**.

It was carried out in collaboration with the university's electronics laboratories.
